# Code Club Outline and Contract 
### Connor Pettitt - 27-11-2017

**Abstract**: A "Contract" proposal for the second academic session for Code Club Beginners and Improvers. I hope for this proposal to give rise to a document that can be handed to the kids and their parents so they know what we expect of them, and what they should expect to do at Code Club. It should give us a bit of leverage to get the kids to behave better, and it could be considered a trial run for next year. Feel free to add your own points and sections. If any of the points below seem too abstract or adult oriented, you can edit the document in github to try to frame the point differently, or add a comment at the end of the line (no changes will be lost, the document can always be reverted).

## Beginners Outline

1. First session outline programming (simple) at Code Club.
  * What they can expect from the lessons.
  * What is expected of them in the sessions.
  * Emphasise on the frame of mind they should have to learn how to code.
2. Frame the topic of the session at the start.
3. Start once 80% of pupils sat, and arrival time has passed.
4. Late students will be caught up to speed when the session has started.
5. Student statement to explain summary of Code Club outline.
6. Parent statement to explain summary of the Code Club outline.

## Improvers Outline
#### (**bold additions are new on top of Beginners outline**)

1. First session outline programming (simple + **advanced**) at Code Club:
  * What they can expect from the lessons.
  * What is expected of them in and between the lessons.
  * Emphasise on the frame of mind they should have to learn how to code.
  * **Use of notebooks and reference material is highly encouraged!**

3. **Time before or after lesson to discuss personal interests and projects.**
4. **Projects at Code Club**:
  * Extended focus on a project (keeping notes, and limiting distraction)
  * Permission to write 'rubbish' code.
  * Project planning and code planning - Project Outline/Pseudo.
  * List project deadlines - Christmas, March, Summer.

## TIPS
- Ask adults and friends who are good at coding to help you
- Read through the task sheet once so that you understand it
- Don't be afraid to get it wrong
- If you want to know more about coding, look at what others have made
- Try using google to nsearch things like "how to learn programming" and "how to become a programmer"
