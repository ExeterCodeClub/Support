# Code Club Outline and Contract 
### Connor Pettitt - 27-11-2017

**Abstract**: A "Contract" proposal for the second academic session for Code Club Beginners and Improvers. I hope for this proposal to give rise to a document that can be handed to the kids and their parents so they know what we expect of them, and what they should expect to do at Code Club. It should give us a bit of leverage to get the kids to behave better, and it could be considered a trial run for next year. Feel free to add your own points and sections. If any of the points below seem too abstract or adult oriented, you can edit the document in github to try to frame the point differently, or add a comment at the end of the line (no changes will be lost, the document can always be reverted).

## Beginners Outline

1. First session outline programming (simple) at Code Club.
  * What they can expect from the lessons.
  * What is expected of them in and between the lessons.
  * Emphasise on the frame of mind they should have to learn how to code.
2. Frame the topic of the lesson every time they start.
3. Start lesson once 80% of pupils sat, and arrival time has passed.
4. Late students will be caught up to speed when the lesson has started.
5. Student statement to explain summary of Code Club outline.
6. Parent statement to explain summary of the Code Club outline.

## Improvers Outline
#### (**bold additions are new on top of Beginners outline**)

1. First session outline programming (simple + **advanced**) at Code Club:
  * What they can expect from the lessons.
  * What is expected of them in and between the lessons.
  * Emphasise on the frame of mind they should have to learn how to code.
  * **Use of notebooks and reference material is highly encouraged!**
2. Frame the topic of the lesson every time they start. 
3. **Time before or after lesson to discuss personal interests and projects.**
4. **Projects at Code Club**:
  * Extended focus on a project (keeping notes, and limiting distraction)
  * 'Permission' to write rubbish code.
  * Project planning and code planning - Project Outline/Pseudo.
  * List project deadlines - Christmas, March, Summer.
5. Student statement to explain summary of Code Club outline.
6. Parent statement to explain summary of Code Club outline.


# Outline Document Draft 
**(the bullet points are to be expanded into sentences that will give useful information to the kids as well as their parents)**

## What you can expect at code club
- Learn the basics of programming through completing challenges
- Types of challenge
- How many challenges we have for you to complete
- Code club online material 
- Working speed and not completing a challenge


## What we expect from you at code club
- To learn by getting things right or wrong
- To have fun without disrupting others
- To share your personal additions towards the end if time
- To put in the effort to complete the challenges, or ask for help


## If coding seems too hard for you, that can be changed
- Maybe you are not breaking down the problem far enough
- Maybe you are afraid of making a mistake and being seen as 'dumb'
- Maybe you don't understand the problem well enough to solve it

## The programmer mindset
- Don't be afraid of doing the obvious first, a better method may come later
- Plan your code ahead of time (or read through the problem sheet once before beginning)
- Learn to break problem tasks down into easy steps
    - If the step is too hard break it down further
    - If that step is too hard, ask someone else (teacher or search engine)
- You will forget things, take notes in a small notebook to jog your memory
- You have permission to be curious and learn anything
- Don't be afraid to write 'bad' code, just write however you like
    what matters is that it works.
- If you want to know more about programming, ask look for what others have done
- Try searching the web, things like "how to become a programmer", quora will have good answers
- The internet has almost unlimited free resources to learn from
