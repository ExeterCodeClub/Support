# Timelapse PiCamera Project Outline
### Connor Pettitt - 2018-01-11
**Abstract**: This document aims to outline the basic tasks to follow in order to complete the improvers' timelapse camera project. I believe that we need to provide more structure in order to increase the productivity of each session (and reduce the chaos just a little). We should still aim to allow room for imagination and spontaneity within the design of the project.

## Team Categories (which tasks could be considered overarching and separately achievable?)

- Setup picam module to take good pictures and store files
- design program logic (when to take pictures, movement detection?)
- turn time lapse images into video to watch back over
- design case to store rpi inside
